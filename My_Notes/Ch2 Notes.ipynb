    "Theano separates the definition and evaluation of mathematical expressions. And, more crucially, allows for optimisation of the expression before evaluating it. Instead of evaluating the epxresisons immediately it builds up a \"compute graph\" (think of it like a kind of lazy evaluation) and once it has the entire graph it can then apply some optimisations - such as arithmetic simplification, compiling to C, or making use of the GPU.\n",

    "This is why you need to know about Theano. The functions you create to define a deterministic variable must use theano functions to build up the symbolic graph. It's easy to forget this as many of the theano functions just look like normal operations & function calls, but if you used a function from any old library in a deterministic variable definition it would evaluate it immediately rather than add it to the \"compute graph\".\n",
